# coding-assessment


## Description

### Motivation

Creating the coding asessment application gave me a glimpse into the interview process ahead and I was also able to use a variety of new skills we learned last week in bootcamp along with building a deployed app with no starter code.

### Why?

To help familiarize you with these tests that are often used in interviews and building a repository from scratch was great practise.

### Problem Solved

Users can practise being timed while answering questions and testing their knowledge so they can go into an intervirew more prepared.

### Learnings

We learned to create timers, display messages and to keep track of points as well as store them along with other data in local storage.
