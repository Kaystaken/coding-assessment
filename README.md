# coding-assessment


## Description

### Motivation

Creating the coding asessment application gave me a glimpse into the interview process ahead and I was also able to use a variety of new skills we learned last week in bootcamp along with building a deployed app with no starter code.

### Why?

To help familiarize you with these tests that are often used in interviews and building a repository from scratch was great practise.

### Problem Solved

Users can practise being timed while answering questions and testing their knowledge so they can go into an interview more prepared.

### Learnings

We learned to create timers, display multiple questions with the option to click from a variety of answers. We are able to keep track of the score as well as store them along with other data in local storage. To store groups of data in a single variable, we use arrays, the entire array can be accessed by using the array's name. To log a single element, we use the name of the array with the index in brackets and Arrays are zero-indexed, so the index of first element in the array is 0. The index can be used in place of data in an array.
